# I <3 Bash

Bash is a underappreaciated language. It falls into this same category as
Makefile where developers learn just enough of it to complete their tasks. As
a result most of the bash code out there is written by beginners. Which then
in turn gives a bad reputation to the language.

The number one issue with Bash is variable escaping. If a variable is used in
it's unescaped form and contains one or many whitespace characters in it, it
creates undefined behaviour in the program.

Bash gets a unecessarily bad reputation because of escaping issues. These are moslty avoidable by using Bash arrays, and [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/).

Even after coding for a long time, I still have to search for how to do things. The [Pure Bash Bible](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pure-bash-bible) has turned that search way down.
